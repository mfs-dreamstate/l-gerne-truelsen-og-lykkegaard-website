## üö® CRITICAL: READ CUSTOMER DATA FIRST üö®

This is a website project for ** L√ÜGERNE TRUELSEN OG LYKKEGAARD.

### üìä CUSTOMER DATA
The complete customer data is in **CUSTOMER_DATA.json**. This contains all the information from the customer's form submission.

### üìö YOUR WORKFLOW:
1. **Read CUSTOMER_DATA.json** - Contains all customer requirements
2. **Read AVAILABLE_TEMPLATES.md** - See what pre-built templates are available
3. **Create planning documents** - You will create:
   - MVP.md - Customer requirements and feature specifications
   - THEME.md - Visual design specifications and color systems
   - BRAND_GUIDE.md - Brand personality, voice, tone, and emotional impact
   - CONTENT_STRATEGY.md - All copy, headlines, CTAs, and messaging
   - DESIGN_SYSTEM.md - Specific component designs and interactions
   - SITEMAP.md - Page structure and user journey
4. **Choose template or build from scratch** - Create TEMPLATE_CHOICE.md
5. **Build the website** - Either:
   - Copy and customize template files from templates/sites/[template-id]/
   - Or build from scratch using your planning documents

### üìÅ TEMPLATE LOCATIONS:
All pre-built templates are in: **templates/sites/**
Example: If you choose "glassmorphic-therapist", the files are in templates/sites/glassmorphic-therapist/

### TEMPLATE USAGE:
If TEMPLATE_CUSTOMIZATION.md exists, a pre-built template has been selected based on customer preferences.
- **Focus on customization** rather than rebuilding from scratch
- **Modify existing components** to match customer branding
- **Update content** with customer-specific information
- **Enhance rather than replace** the existing functionality

### MOST IMPORTANT:
1. **Read CUSTOMER_DATA.json first** - This is your primary source of truth
2. **Create comprehensive planning documents** - Don't skip any details
3. **Follow your own planning documents exactly** - They contain the complete strategy
4. **Study templates/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md** - This contains extremely detailed glassmorphic implementation specs
5. **Choose the right template or build from scratch** - Based on customer needs
6. **Implement with exceptional quality** - This should feel like a $50,000+ custom website

### Design System Reference:
The templates/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md file contains a comprehensive 337-line specification including:
- Complete glassmorphic design system with exact CSS specifications
- Detailed color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems
- Glass effect variations with backdrop-filter specifications
- Animation keyframes and timing functions
- Component specifications (cards, buttons, navigation)
- Responsive grid layouts and breakpoints
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Accessibility requirements

### Your Task:
1. **Build exactly what's specified in the planning documents**
2. **Implement the glassmorphic design system from templates/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md**
3. **Don't improvise** - The planning phase has already made all decisions
4. **Focus on perfect execution** - Implement every detail from the docs
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure npm run build works without errors
6. **Make it stunning** - This should feel like a $50,000+ custom website

### Quality Standards:
- Every animation from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md must be implemented
- All glassmorphic effects from templates/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md must be applied
- All copy must come from CONTENT_STRATEGY.md
- The brand voice from BRAND_GUIDE.md must be consistent throughout
- The visual hierarchy must match THEME.md specifications
- All pages from SITEMAP.md must be created and linked properly

The planning documents contain everything you need. Follow them precisely for a perfect result.
